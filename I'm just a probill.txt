Boy: Woof! You sure got to go through a 
lot of steps to get to paid status here 
at AFS Vista. But I wonder who that sad 
little scrap of paper is?

ProBill: I'm just a probill
Yes, I'm only a probill
And I'm sitting here awaiting to be entered in freight payment
Well, it's a long, long journey
To the client close
It's a long, long wait
While I'm sitting in Prerating
But I know I'll be paid someday
At least I hope and pray that I will
But today I am still just an unpaid probill

Boy: Gee, ProBill, you certainly have a lot of patience and courage

ProBill: Well I got this far. When I started, I wasn't even a probill, 
I was just paper needing to be scanned. A carrier sent me in the mail.

I'm just a probill
Yes, I'm only a probill,
And I got as far as Awaiting Business Rules
Well, now I'm stuck in QC
And I'll sit here and wait
While a few Operations People discuss and debate
Whether they should let me be passed through
How I hope and pray that they will
But today I am still just an unpaid probill

Boy: Listen to those Operations People arguing! Is all that discussion and debate about you?

ProBill: Yeah, I'm one of the unlucky ones. Most probills never get held up. I hope they decide to fix or pass me through, otherwise I may get denied.

Boy: Denied?

ProBill: Yeah, denied internally or by the client. Oh, but it looks like I'm going to live! Now I go to Queued Status, and they eventually they may mark me paid.

Boy: If they do queue you, what happens?

ProBill: Then I go to the Business Rules and the whole thing starts all over again.

Boy: Oh no!

ProBill: Oh yes!

I'm just a probill
Yes, I'm only a probill
And if I clear business rules and rating
Well, then I'm off to production
Where I'll wait in a line
With a lot of other probills
For the Production Manager to pay
And if it doesn't exclude me, then I'll be paid
How I hope and pray that it will
But today I am still just an unpaid probill

Boy: You mean even if the whole system says you should be paid, Production Manager can still say no?

Probill: Yes, that's called excluded from production. If Production Manager excludes me, I have to go back to the CSR to be fixed

Boy: By that time the carrier is probably very unhappy. It's not easy to become paid, is it?

ProBill: No!

But how I hope and I pray that I will
But today I am still just an unpaid probill

Person Running Production: You didn't get excluded from production, ProBill! Now you're paid!

ProBill: Oh yes!
